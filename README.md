# Oblik Toolkit

A collection of minimalistic components and utilities. Optionally, the Watcher (inspired by [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)) can be used to glue them all together and allow them to be used just with HTML markup.

Core values and goals:

1. **Options.** Before everything, Oblik's goal is to help you. It doesn't provide complex do-it-all solutions. Instead, it provides simple functionality that could be extended to fit your own use cases.
1. **Renderless.** Components use as little CSS and DOM mutations as possible. They provide just JavaScript functionality while design and markup are left in your hands, allowing you to achieve a unique look and feel.
1. **Modularity.** The project uses [ES6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) so you can import just the things you need. You can use a single utility function or component, but you can also add a bundle containing everything.
1. **Compatibility.** While modern browsers are the target and modern features are used, everything should be working fine up to IE11. Various parts of the Toolkit could work in even older browsers.

# Usage

First, you have to install Oblik. It's currently not available on the npm registry, but you could add it as a submodule with Git:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/oblikjs/oblik
```

## Utility

The most minimal way to use the Toolkit is to import a single utility. For example, the `Drag` class. It allows you to handle drag gestures on mobile and desktop at once:

```js
import { Drag } from 'oblik/utils/drag'

let d = new Drag(document.body)
d.on('start', event => {}) // mousedown, touchstart
d.on('move', event => {}) // mousemove, touchmove
d.on('end', event => {}) // mouseup, mouseleave, touchend, touchcancel
```

## Component

If you need something more, components provide advanced functionality. They are simple classes (constructor functions) with three arguments:

- `element` to which they are attached to
- `options` that alter the component's behavior
- `parent` component

To be more organized, components are divided into three groups:

- _functional_ do small things like scrolling to a part of the page, monitoring an element's height so it can be animated with CSS, toggling a class based on some user event...
- _interface_ provide the usual slider, accordion, masonry grid...
- _misc_ do random stuff like allowing you to use an HTML element as cursor, splitting text in an element by words so you can animate them...

The _slider_ component, for example, uses the `Drag` utility shown earlier. You can use it like this:

```js
// main component
import Slider from 'oblik/components/interface/slider'

// subcomponent
let Slide = Slider.$components.slide

let sliderEl = document.getElementById('slider')
let slideEls = sliderEl.getElementsByClassName('slide')

let slider = new Slider(sliderEl)

for (let slide of slideEls) {
	new Slide(
		slide,	// element
		null,	 // options
		slider	// parent
	)
}

slider.$init()
```

## Watcher

Initializing components in JavaScript with `id` or `class` hooks can become problematic as a project grows. The `Watcher` class allows you to register all components you need and then use HTML attributes to both initialize them and specify options. The slider example from earlier can be done like this:

```js
import Watcher from 'oblik/watcher'
import Slider from 'oblik/components/interface/slider'

let w = new Watcher(document.body, {
	components: {
		slider: Slider
	}
})

w.init()
```

Then, the target element (in this case, `document.body`) will be monitored with a [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) and components can easily be attached to elements:

```html
<body>
	<div ob-slider>
		<div ob-slider-slide>1</div>
		<div ob-slider-slide>1</div>
		<div ob-slider-slide>3</div>
		<div ob-slider-slide>4</div>
	</div>
</body>
```

### Options

To configure settings from within the markup, you can use the [Single Line Configuration](https://github.com/oblikjs/slic) format, which is basically JSON with a few tweaks that allow it to be used in HTML attributes easier.

Now, you'll see an example with the _toggle_ component. Based on an `on` and `off` handler, it adds/removes a class:

```html
<i ob-toggle="target: @sibling, class: is-shown">?</i>
<div class="tooltip">
	<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
</div>
```

Here, we set the `target` option to `@sibling` which is used by the [Query](https://github.com/oblikjs/querel) utility to find elements relative to other elements. In this case, the target would be `.tooltip`. The default event is `click` and the added class is set to `is-shown`. The final result isâ€”click events on `<i>` toggle the `is-shown` class on `.tooltip`.

If the SLIC format doesn't suit you, JSON can be used for options as well:

```html
<i ob-toggle='{"target": "@sibling", "class": "is-shown"}'>?</i>
```

#### Defaults

Let's say we want the default handlers to be `mouseover` and `mouseout`. We wouldn't want to specify them on each element. This is where defaults come in handy. They are set on the component's constructor like this:

```js
import Watcher from 'oblik/watcher'
import Toggle from 'oblik/components/functional/toggle'

Toggle.$defaults = {
	target: '@sibling',
	on: 'mouseover',
	off: 'mouseout',
	class: 'is-shown'
}

let w = new Watcher(document.body, {
	components: {
		toggle: Toggle
	}
})

w.init()
```

We can now change the markup to this:

```html
<i ob-toggle>?</i>
<div class="tooltip">
	<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
</div>
```

And the `is-shown` class will be added to the sibling of the component element on `mouseover` and removed on `mouseout`.

#### Presets

Perhaps we have a lot of toggles that work with `click` and we want that to be the default, but we also have a lot of toggles with mouse triggers. We can move the `on` and `off` options to a preset:

```js
Toggle.$defaults = {
	on: 'click',
	off: 'click',
	class: 'is-active'
}

Toggle.$presets = {
	tooltip: {
		target: '@sibling',
		on: 'mouseover',
		off: 'mouseout',
		class: 'is-shown'
	}
}
```

Now we have default options and a preset that will override those defaults when used. Take the following three examples:

```html
<div class="drawer">
	<button id="one" ob-toggle="target: @parent"></button>
</div>

<i id="two" ob-toggle="tooltip">?</i>
<div class="tooltip">
	<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
</div>

<div>
	<i id="three" ob-toggle="$preset: tooltip, target: @parent.sibling">?</i>
</div>
<div class="tooltip">
	<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
</div>
```

1. Default options are used and `.drawer` has `is-active` toggled on `click`
2. When the attribute value is a plain string, it is interpreted as a preset. In this case, the `tooltip` preset is used and the component's next sibling would have `is-shown` toggled on mouse events.
3. The same preset is used here too, but the `target` option is overridden. Instead of targeting the component's sibling, we target the sibling of its parent.

#### JavaScript

Keep in mind that you can use the same patterns in JavaScript as well. If you don't use the Watcher, the earlier examples can be done like this:

```js
import Toggle from 'oblik/components/functional/toggle'

Toggle.$defaults = { ... }
Toggle.$presets = { tooltip: { ... } }

new Toggle(document.getElementById('one'), {
	target: '@parent'
})

new Toggle(document.getElementById('two'), 'tooltip')

new Toggle(document.getElementById('three'), {
	$preset: 'tooltip',
	target: '@parent.sibling'
})
```

## Customization

You'll often need special solutions to certain problems. Oblik might not be able to provide them right away, but it could still help you create them yourself.

### Custom Components

As mentioned earlier, a component is just a simple constructor function or an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), which is syntactic sugar for a constructor function. Here's an example with a plain function:

```js
import Watcher from 'oblik/watcher'

let w = new Watcher(document.body, {
	components: {
		foo: function (element, options) {
			element.style.backgroundColor = options.color
		}
	}
})
```

Then we use the component like so:

```html
<div ob-foo="color: red"></div>
```

### Extending the Base Component

We can achieve much more by [extending](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Sub_classing_with_extends) the base Oblik component. It's the foundation of all components and provides useful functionality like the `$defaults` and `$presets` shown earlier, an [event emitter](https://github.com/scottcorgan/tiny-emitter#readme), managing references to subcomponents, and hooks. It can also specify other components as subcomponents. Let's create a component:

```js
import Watcher from 'oblik/watcher'
import Component from 'oblik/components/component'

let w = new Watcher(document.body, {
	components: {
		foo: class extends Component {
			static $defaults = {
				test: 42
			}

			$create () {
				console.log('created', this.$element, this.$options)
			}

			$init () {
				console.log('ready')
			}

			$destroy () {
				console.log('removed')
			}
		}
	}
})

w.init()
```

We just created a component with a few hooks:

- `$create` is called just after the component's creation and after its options have been resolved
- `$init` is called when all subcomponents are initialized
- `$destroy` is called when the component is removed from the DOM

Because the Watcher uses a [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver), adding and removing components is handled automatically. This means new instances of our component will be created and destroyed accordingly when changing HTML or when using reactive frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

**Note:** While the base component is good for building something new, you can also extend pre-existing components.

#### Subcomponents

When a component has child elements of interest, it makes sense to use a subcomponent. Such component is defined with the `$components` property:

```js
class Child extends Component { }

class Parent extends Component {
	static $components = {
		bar: Child
	}

	$create () {
		this.$emitter.on('bar:added', component => {
			console.log('added', component)
		})
	}

	$init () {
		console.log('child', this.$bar)
	}
}

let w = new Watcher(document.body, {
	components: {
		foo: Parent
	}
})
```

A few things happen:

1. We declare class `Parent` as component `foo` that has class `Child` as subcomponent `bar`.
1. The `$create` hook is called before the child is created and we use the base component's `$emitter` so we can know when a new `bar` subcomponent is added.
1. To easily reference the child, the `$bar` property is automatically set on the parent when the child is created.
1. The `$init` hook is called after all subcomponents have initialized.

Then, we use these components like so:

```html
<div ob-foo>
	<span ob-foo-bar></span>
</div>
```

If we need multiple `bar` instances, all we have to do is set `$bar` to an empty array beforehand. Multiple occurrences of `ob-foo-bar` will be tracked in that array:

```js
class Parent extends Component {
	static $components = {
		bar: Child
	}

	$create () {
		this.$bar = []
		this.$emitter.on('bar:added', component => {
			console.log('added', component)
		})
	}

	$init () {
		console.log('children', this.$bar)
	}
}
```

```html
<div ob-foo>
	<span ob-foo-bar></span>
	<span ob-foo-bar></span>
	<span ob-foo-bar></span>
</div>
```

The logged message in `$init` would contain all three `<span>` tags.

### Wrapping Other Libraries

Perhaps there's already a solution to your problem. Well, Oblik's base component and Watcher can still help you a lot. Let's wrap the [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) tooltip library in an Oblik component:

```js
import Watcher from 'oblik/watcher'
import Component from 'oblik/components/component'
import tippy from 'tippy.js'

class Tooltip extends Component {
	static $defaults = {
		theme: 'dark',
		trigger: 'click',
		interactie: true
	}

	$create () {
		this.instance = tippy(this.$element, this.$options)
	}

	$destroy () {
		this.instance.destroy()
	}
}

let w = new Watcher(document.body, {
	components: {
		tooltip: Tooltip
	}
})
```

```html
<span ob-tooltip="content: Lorem Ipsum!">Hello</span>
```

By doing this, we get the following benefits:

- New tooltips are added with just markup
- Tippy's options can be specified in the markup
- Dynamically added tooltips to the DOM are initialized automatically
- Removed tooltips from the DOM are cleared automatically
- Default options could be specified with `$defaults`
- Multiple option configurations can be added as `$presets` for even greater flexibility
